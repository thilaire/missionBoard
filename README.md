# What is *MissionBoard* ?

It's a simple DIY project I made for my kids: it consists in a wallet with a lot of buttons and some electronics (Raspberry Pi) to let them play and have fun playing and piloting a spaceship.

So this is the plan: I will design something that can fit in a case, and this github will collect all the data for this project. I will try to post pictures, scheme and code, so that anyone can do the same, learn from my experience and mistakes, and make a better mission control desk for its kids.

All the information is collected in that github. Please, refer to the [dedicated github page](https://thilaire.github.io/missionBoard/) with all the documation, pictures and howto.
