# Design the panels

## Bottom panels

The panels have been designed from the [functionalities](functionalities.md) and [material list](bom.md).

Adobe Illustrator has been used to design the two faces of the panels, and anticipate the footprint of every component. More details (and the illustrator file) [here](../illustrator.md)
