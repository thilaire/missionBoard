# Design the panels

## Bottom panels

The panels have been designed from the [functionalities](functionalities.md) and [material list](bom.md).

Adobe Illustrator has been used to design the two faces of the panels, and anticipate the footprint of every component.
The illustrator file (and details) can be found [here](illustrator.md).
