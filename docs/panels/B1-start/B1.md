# Bottom 1) *Start/mode* panel

![panel](B1-design.jpg)

This panel is composed of:
- a key switch (`B1_SW-KEY`) for the on/off
- a green led (`B1_LED` aka `LED_OnOff`) for the on/off
- a 3-position rotationary switch (`B1_SW3`, aka ``SW3_gameMode`) for the mode (spaceship/game/computer)

## Connections

- The switch `B1_SW3` is connected to pins 0 and 1 of the TM#4
- the LED is connected to pin 1 of the TM#4
- the key switch `B1_SW-KEY` is (for the moment) between `VCC` and the +5V from the power supply (it swithces on and off all the components of the board, including the Raspberry Pi).
