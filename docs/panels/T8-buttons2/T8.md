This panel is composed of:
- two 2-position switches (`T8_SW2_1` and `T8_SW2_2`, aka `SW2_light_cabin` and `SW2_light_outside`) and the associated LEDs (`T8_LED_1` and `T8_LED_2`, aka `LED_light_cabin` and `LED_light_outside`) for the lights.
- three 2-position switches (`T8_SW2_3`, `T8_SW2_4` and `T8_SW2_5`, aka `SW2_solar`, `SW2_battery` and `SW2_fuel_cell`) and the associated LEDs (`T8_LED_3`, `T8_LED_4` and `T8_LED_5`, aka `LED_solar`, `LED_battery` and `LED_fuel_cell`) for the electricity sources.
- a 2-position switch for the gate (`T8_SW2_6` aka `SW2_computer`), that can switch between main and backup computer.
