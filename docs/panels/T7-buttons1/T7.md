This panel is composed of:
- two 2-position switches (`T7_SW2_1` and `T7_SW2_2`, aka `SW2_turbo_gas` and `SW2_turbo_boost`) and the associated LEDs (`T7_LED_1` and `T7_LED_2`, aka `LED_turbo_gas` and `LED_turbo_boost`).
- a 3-position switch for the gate (`T7_SW3` aka `T7_gates`), that can switch between open the gate 1, close the two gates and open the gate 2.
