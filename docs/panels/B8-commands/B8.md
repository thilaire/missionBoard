# Bottom 8) *Commands* panel

![panel](B8-design.jpg)

This panel is composed of:
- 9 arcade-style buttons:
  - push buttons (`B8_PB_0` to `B8_PB_8`)
  - with 9 RGB LEDs (`B8_RGB_0` to `B8_RGB_8`)
(the last one is a big red button)

## Insert the RGB Led into the buttons

The arcade-style push buttons are delivered with a simple white LED inside.
But it is not difficult to remove that LED and install instead a RGB LED like the [WS2812 or clones](APA106.md). It just requires to drew a little bit the plastic support and wire correctly the LED. See the pictures or [this guide](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arcade-Button-RGB-LED-Conversion/) (in my version, I have decided to keep the original LED connectors, used for `GND` and `VCC` for all the LED. It reduces a lot the number of wires !).


## Connections

The `Data_In` of the RGB LEDs comes from the `Data_Out` of the RGB LEDs of the [panel 2](panels/2-displays/2.md).
See [here](APA106.md) for more details on RGB LEDs.
