# Bottom 3) *Laser* panel

![panel](B3-design.jpg)

This panel is composed of:
- a rocket switch (`B3_SW2_0` aka `SW2_laser`) to arm the laser
- a 2-position toggle-switch (`B3_SW2_1` aka `SW2_laserColor`) for the color (red/blue)

## Connections

- the color switch `B3_SW2_1` is connected to pin 7 of the TM #4

- The `B3_SW2_0` switch is connected to the analog port `AT_PC2` (see [how to put several digital input on a single analog input](../../multiple-inputs.md)), on position `0`, so it is seen from the RPi as coming from TM#7, pin 7.
