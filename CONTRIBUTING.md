Feel free to contribute to this project by contacting me (thibault@docmatic.fr) or sending pull requests.

Any contribution that can make this project better will be appreciated. The main idea is to provide all the documentation and code necessary so that any dad/mum can make a similar missionBoard for their kids (or for themselves!)
